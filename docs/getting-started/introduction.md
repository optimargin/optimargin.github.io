We have worked hard to make the onboarding process as easy and pain-free as possible.

There are three main steps to set up OptiMargin:
- create a [secure server]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/secure-server/) that holds your data and runs simulations.
- set up an [automatic connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/fcm-connection/) to your FCM(s).
- [install]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/installation/) and [configure]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/configuration/) OptiMargin.

We are happy to help as much or as little as needed.

If you have any questions along the way, please contact [{{ site.help_email }}](mailto: {{ site.help_email }}).
