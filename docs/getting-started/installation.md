To install OptiMargin, just download and run the [installer](https://optimargin.com/uploads/setup.exe).

*optional:* verify the checksum (MD5) of *setup.exe*: `2dd2bbf9ef08ae3d3f21ec5122481758`.

By default, the OptiMargin App sends error logs (with absolutely **no** user data) to our IT team in order to more quickly identify and resolve potential problems. If you would rather disable this feature and have no outgoing logs, click `Advanced` during the installation process and uncheck `Automatically send diagnostic error logs`.

After installation, OptiMargin will run automatically.

Input your `client id` and `password` provided by the OptiMargin team.

You can manage the OptiMargin process through the `Windows Services Manager` (`OptiMargin Services` and `OptiMargin UI`)
